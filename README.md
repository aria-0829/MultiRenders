## MultiRenders

This project is built upon the **MonoGame** application framework. The primary objective is to implement custom shaders. The project has three sections with different render scenes. 
- Utilize tool window for changing state sections.
#### Section 1
- Mouse-controlled model movement using cursor and wheel scrolls. 
- Each pixel color of the model is determined by its current world position. 
#### Section 2

- Custom shader with Lambertian lighting, specular highlighting nad texture mapping.
- Dynamic adjustment of light source position with mouse cursor movement.
#### Section 3

- Spawn cubes randomly around a sphere on left mouse button press.
- Cubes move towards the sphere until they touch the sphere and disappear.
